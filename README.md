# TenShillings-RC6-Widget-VB6

An example of a moveable/resizable single-image, VB6 / TwinBasic program using the RC6 widget framework, complete with right click menu, help, about and licence forms and help CHM.

The program does very little but place some eye-candy on the desktop in the manner of the old Yahoo Widget/Konfabulator engine.

You can add more logic as you require or replace the main image with your own. 

This is merely a template for other single-image VB6 / TwinBasic RC6 programs that I knocked up late at night whilst drinking gin and tonic.
